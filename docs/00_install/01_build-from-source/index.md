content_title: Build ARISEN from Source
---

[[info | Building ARISEN is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to ARISEN, it is recommended that you install the [ARISEN Prebuilt Binaries](../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.

ARISEN can be built on several platforms using different build methods. Advanced users may opt to build ARISEN using our shell scripts. Node operators or block producers who wish to deploy a public node, may prefer our manual build instructions.

* [Shell Scripts](01_shell-scripts/index.md) - Suitable for the majority of developers, these scripts build on Mac OS and many flavors of Linux.
* [Manual Build](02_manual-build/index.md) - Suitable for those platforms that may be hostile to the shell scripts or for operators who need more control over their builds.

[[info | ARISEN Installation Recommended]]
| After building ARISEN successfully, it is highly recommended to install the ARISEN binaries from their default build directory. This copies the ARISEN binaries to a central location, such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/arisen/x.y/bin`, where `x.y` is the ARISEN release version.
