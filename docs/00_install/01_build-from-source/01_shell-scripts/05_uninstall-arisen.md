content_title: Uninstall ARISEN
---

If you have previously built ARISEN from source and now wish to install the prebuilt binaries, or to build from source again, it is recommended to run the `arisen_uninstall.sh` script within the `rsn/scripts` folder:

```sh
cd ~/arisen/rsn
sudo ./scripts/arisen_uninstall.sh
```

[[info | Uninstall Dependencies]]
| The uninstall script will also prompt the user to uninstall ARISEN dependencies. This is recommended if installing prebuilt ARISEN binaries or building ARISEN for the first time.
