[[info | Did you know?]]
| Shell scripts automate the process of building, installing, testing, and uninstalling the ARISEN software and dependencies.

To build ARISEN from the source code using shell scripts, visit the sections below:

1. [Download ARISEN Source](01_download-arisen-source.md)
2. [Build ARISEN Binaries](02_build-arisen-binaries.md)
3. [Install ARISEN Binaries](03_install-arisen-binaries.md)
4. [Test ARISEN Binaries](04_test-arisen-binaries.md)
5. [Uninstall ARISEN](05_uninstall-arisen.md)

[[info | Building ARISEN is for Advanced Developers]]
| If you are new to ARISEN, it is recommended that you install the [ARISEN Prebuilt Binaries](../../00_install-prebuilt-binaries.md) instead of building from source.
